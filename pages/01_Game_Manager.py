st.header("A. Project Description and Context")
st.markdown("""
The **Game Manager v2** system is an application designed to manage gaming machines across multiple branches.
- **Technology Stack:**
    - **Back-end:** Node.js / Express.js
    - **Database:** SQLite / Sequelize ORM
    - **Front-end:** React.js / Bootstrap
- **Core Functionality:**
    - Manage machine information (name, machine code, branch, type).
    - Enter and edit daily point transactions.
    - View transaction history and statistics.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Soft Delete:** Data is never permanently deleted, allowing for easy recovery.
    - **Automatic Balance Calculation:** The balance is calculated based on the latest transaction, ensuring accuracy.
    - **Rate Management:** Allows for setting and changing point conversion rates.
    - **Demo Mode:** Permits data overwriting for testing purposes without affecting production data.
    - **Data Entry Control:** Prevents and warns against data overwriting for duplicate dates (in Production mode) and only allows the most recent transaction to be edited.
    - **Change History:** Logs data changes on a per-branch basis.
    - **Security:** Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and role-based (Admin/User) and branch-based authorization.
- **API Endpoints:** Provides key APIs for login, CRUD operations for machines, branches, point transactions, and history viewing.

st.header("B. Role of the Business Analyst (BA)")
st.markdown("""
In this project, I served as the Business Analyst, with the following responsibilities:
- **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:** Worked with stakeholders to identify core problems such as data overwriting, difficulty in tracking balances, and the need for a clear, transparent transaction history.
- **Stakeholder Identification:**
    - **Admin:** Manages the entire system.
    - **Branch Staff:** End-users responsible for daily data entry.
    - **Accountant:** Monitors and audits the data.
- **Solution Proposal:** Based on the analysis, I proposed technical solutions and business processes, such as the anti-overwrite mechanism, a demo mode, and the data modification workflow.
- **Documentation:** Created a complete set of business documents to ensure the development team and stakeholders had a shared understanding of the system.

        - The system must allow users to log in with a username and password.

    - **FR2: Branch Management (Admin):**
        - Admins can add, view, edit, and soft-delete branches.
    - **FR3: Machine Management (Admin):**
        - Admins can add, view, edit, soft-delete machines, and assign them to a branch.
    - **FR4: Point Transaction Management (User):**
        - Users can enter points (points_in, points_out) for a machine in their branch by date.
        - The system must automatically calculate the `current_balance` and `daily_point`.

        - In Production mode, the system must prevent users from entering a transaction on a date that already has data and must display a warning.
        - In Demo mode, the system allows data overwriting.
    - **FR6: Transaction Editing:**
        - Users are only allowed to edit the most recent transaction for a machine.
